Made with python 3.9. It uses the following libraries: speech_recognition, selenium, moviepy, pydub


It uses google's speech recognition as well as a deepl.com scraper for translating.
Usually it works pretty well with the default variables but you can tweak the SILENCE and THRESH
variables in the subtitler.py file for better results. To pick a language to translate from, change
the LANG variable. To pick a language to translate to, change the TRANSLATE_TO variable.

To launch the app run the launch.bat file and enter the filename/path of the video you want to add subtitles to.
